# virusNewFolder
This Python script creates multiple folders with the name "Malicious" followed by a number (e.g., Malicious1, Malicious2). It continues until an error occurs. The script also provides terminal commands to remove the created folders using ls, rm, and find with sudo, explaining each step for safe deletion.
